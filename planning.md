| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planning | The planning process overall went well </br> Split up work effectively | Planning didn't all happen at once -- multiple planning stages | Come up with deadlines for each component |
| Communication | Overall OK, kept in contact and updated when tasks completed | Could make better use of Issues for communicating progress | Use Issues, Milestones more frequently |
| Execution | Finished on time, got code running | Could adhere to DRY standards more </br> Code organization was messy | Break code out into utility files </br> Separate test files for different things |

| Planning |The planning went well as we discussed which routes to complete in the beginning |We could have been more specific about organizing the code to make it look more clean. In the end the server.py and test_server.py ended up being very hard to navigate | We can be more specific in deadlines as we ended up going with the flow and trusting each other|
| Communication |Communication was overall good, we used text message and I am very easy to reach with text message| Could make better use of issues and set deadlines|  We will communicate more about deadlines and expectations|
| Execution | We completed on time and everything (to our knowledge) ended up working| The code was messy and ended up being hard to read at the end| We can commit more often and touch base more frequently. We should also look at each other's unit test because we did not do that |
